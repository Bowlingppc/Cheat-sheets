# *****************************************************************************
# CODING STYLE 
# *****************************************************************************

#-----> Make your code readable:

# 1. Avoid abbreviating variable names.
# 2. Write out your function argument names.
# 3. Document your classes and methods.
# 4. Comment your code.
# 5. Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
# 6. Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling.

# Should not be necessary to read an entire function or method.
# Avoid using personal pronouns in comments, e.g. "We check request method" rather than "Get request method".
# Use underscores instead of camelCase, e.g. 'loop_counter' instead of 'LoopCounter'.
# Use Flake8 for Checking Code Quality.


#-----> Imports:

# Imports should be grouped in the following order:
# 1. __future__ imports.
# 2. Standard library imports.
# 3. Third-party app imports.
# 4. Core Django imports.
# 5. Your apps imports.

# Use explicit relative imports.
# Avoid using import * in your modules.


#-----> Templates:

# In Django templates put one space between the curly brackets and tag contents, e.g {{ foo }} instead {{foo}}.


#-----> Models:

# Field names in model should be all lowercase, use underscores instead of camelCase again.
# After the fields are defined in the model class, write the Meta class.
# If you have choices in your fields, define each choice as a list of tuples, with an all-uppercase name as a class attribute on the model.


#-----> Others
# Use underscores in URL pattern names rather than dashes.



# *****************************************************************************
# MODELS
# *****************************************************************************

# 1. Register your app model in admin file in your app folder to use admin panel in django.
# 2. Create a superuser using command python manage.py createsuperuser.
# 3. If you've created a new app, you must enter your app name in INSTALLED_APPS in the setting.py file before makemigration so that Django can track your model changes.
# 4. Remember to migrate after you change anything in your models.py file.
# 5. Use /admin/ page to add data in your tables for testing purpose.

# STARTING A SIMPLE DJANGO PROJECT IN PYTHON3
# *****************************************************************************

# 1.  $ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py; python3 get-pip.py						
# 2.  $ pip install virtualenv
# 3.  $ mkdir django-projects
# 4.  $ cd django-projects

# *****************************************************************************
# DEPLOYMENT
# *****************************************************************************

# Add your media, database, venv, __pycache__ to the .gitignore (there is a compelete list that you can find here: https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/blob/master/.gitignore).
# Keep migration files in the git (you will need to migrate them in target server).
# Don't run "makemigrations" in the target server (you will need to just run "migrate").
# $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Make appropriate changes in your project settings.py file (change DEBUG to False and etc).
# Push your code to your git-server.
# Pull your code in your target server.
# Give right permissions to the web-server (e.g. $ chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/myproject).
# Make a new venv in the target server and activate it.
# $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
# sudo ./venv/bin/python3 manage.py migrate
# Restart your web-server (in case of apache: $ sudo service apache2 restart).
