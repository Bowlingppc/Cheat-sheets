> # CODING STYLES
> MAKING YOUR CODE READABLE
> 1. Avoid abbreviating variable names.
> 1. Write out your function argument names.
> 1. Document your classes and methods.
> 1. Comment your code.
> 1. Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
> 1. Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling should not be necessary to read an entire function or method.
> ### *TIP: Use Flake8 for Checking Code Quality.*
> ---
> ## A WORD ON IMPORTS
> ## Imports should be grouped in the following order:
> 1. Standard library imports.
> 1. Core Django imports.
> 1. Third-party app imports.
> 1. Imports from your apps.
> ### *Use explicit relative imports.*
> ### _Avoid using import *_
> ---
> ## OTHERS
> ### *Use underscores in URL pattern names rather than dashes.*

---

> # Deployment
> 1. Add your media, database, venv, __pycache__ to the .gitignore (there is a compelete list that you can find here: [https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/blob/master/.gitignore](https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/blob/master/.gitignore))
> 1. Keep migration files in the git (you will need to migrate them in target server)
> 1. Don't run "makemigrations" in the target server (you will need to just run "migrate")
> 1. ``` $ pip freeze > requirements.txt ```
> 1. Make appropriate changes in your project settings.py file (change DEBUG to False and etc)
> 1. Push your code to your git-server
> 1. Pull your code in your target server
> 1. Give right permissions to the web-server (e.g. $ chown www-data:www-data -R /var/www/myproject)
> 1. Make a new venv in the target server and activate it
> 1. ``` $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt ```
> 1. ``` sudo ./venv/bin/python3 manage.py migrate ```
> 1. Restart your web-server (in case of apache: $ sudo service apache2 restart)

> # Models in Django
> ## Step 1:
> In the code given below, following implementations in your `models.py` file are shown:
> * How to create models
> * Different types of fields - CharField, ImageField, BooleanField, DateTimeField.
> * Usage of `Ckeditor` that can enable *RichTextField* and give an interactive text editor panel to user in Django-Admin page.
> * Implementation of Date and TIme stamp.
> * Proper headline when it is seen in Django Admin page.
>
> ```
> from django.db import models
> from ckeditor.fields import RichTextField
> from datetime import datetime
> # Create your models here.
> class <Model Name>(models.Model):
>
>    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
>    category = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
>    photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='media/home/%Y/%m')
>    content = RichTextField()
>    author = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
>    is_featured = models.BooleanField(default=False)
>    created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.now)
>
>    def __str__(self):
>        return self.title
>  ```
>
> ## Step 2:
> After creating models, we need to register them in `admin.py` page.
> In your `admin.py` add the following code:
> ```
> from django.contrib import admin
> from .models import <Model Name>
>
> admin.site.register(<Model Name>)
> ```
>
> If you want some filters on your Django-Admin page, you can use the following code:
> ```
> from django.contrib import admin
> from .models import <Model Name>
> # Register your models here.
>
> class ModelDisplay(admin.ModelAdmin):
> 
>    list_display = ('id', 'name', 'email', 'subject', 'created_date',) # model fields that you want to display
>    search_fields = ('name', 'email',) # model field that you want to add in search
>    list_display_links = ('id', 'name', 'email',)
>
>
> admin.site.register(<Model Name>, ModelDisplay)
> ```  
> ## Step 3:
> In your terminal run the following commands:
> ```
> python manage.py makemigrations
> python manage.py migrate
> ```
